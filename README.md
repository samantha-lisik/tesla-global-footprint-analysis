🌍 **Tesla Global Footprint Analysis (2015–2025)
Deliveries, CO₂ Impact & Market Segmentation**

📌 **Overview**

This project explores Tesla’s global presence using open-source data covering 2015–2025. The analysis examines:

- **Regional delivery trends**

- **Estimated CO₂ savings**

- **Market differences across regions**

- **Correlation and regression modeling**

- **Cluster-based segmentation of global markets**

- **Time-series performance over a 10-year period**

The results are curated into an interactive Tableau storyboard, highlighting the most meaningful insights for stakeholders.

The storyboard focuses on the final insights. All exploratory steps, intermediate models, and analyses are documented in the notebooks within this repository.

🧠 **Project Objectives**

- Understand Tesla’s global delivery growth and environmental impact

- Compare regional performance and sustainability outcomes

- Identify meaningful relationships (e.g., deliveries ↔ CO₂ savings)

- Segment markets using clustering

- Communicate insights in a clear, business-friendly Tableau narrative

📦 **Data Sources**
1. Tesla Global Deliveries Dataset (Primary)

- Dataset source: [Kaggle – Tesla Global Deliveries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rehan497/tesla-global-deliveries-dataset-20152025)

- Author: Rehan Ahmed

- Includes: deliveries, production, price, CO₂ savings, battery capacity, charging infrastructure, region labels

2. Custom GeoJSON Regions File

- Created to map Tesla metrics by North America, Europe, and Asia

- Used for Tableau geospatial visualizations

3. Time-Series Preparation

- A cleaned dataset extracted for trend analysis of deliveries and sustainability impact

🔍 **Analysis Components**

✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis**

- Pair plots, correlation heatmap, scatterplots

- Early hypotheses formed based on relationships (e.g., deliveries ↔ CO₂ saved)

✔ **Geographic Analysis**

- Regions mapped via a custom GeoJSON

- Shows how Tesla’s environmental impact varies globally

✔ **Regression Modeling**

- Tested the predictive relationship between deliveries and CO₂ savings

- Found a strong positive linear relationship

✔ **Clustering**

- Segmenting regions based on multiple metrics (deliveries, CO₂, production)

- Confirmed that each region behaves uniquely

✔ **Time-Series Analysis**

- Yearly delivery patterns

- Insight into Tesla’s global expansion trajectory

📈 **Key Insights**

- Deliveries and CO₂ savings are strongly correlated, confirming that Tesla’s growth directly scales environmental impact.

- Asia shows the highest delivery volumes, followed by Europe and North America.

- Clustering revealed three distinct regional profiles, highlighting different market characteristics.

- Tesla’s footprint is not uniform globally, and regions require individual strategies.

🧰 **Tools & Technologies**

- Python: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels

- GeoPandas for geospatial processing

- Tableau Public for the final interactive presentation

- Jupyter Notebook for full workflow documentation
